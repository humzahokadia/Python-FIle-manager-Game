the program will welcome you and ask for your name it will then ask how you are doing and give you a motivational sentence. the game will then ask if you are an existing user or not if you are not it will create a password for you if you are it will check your password and if it is correct it will give you access

for option 1 the program will then ask you for the path which you want to work in 

## Must put specific path eg, /Users/humzahokadia/Desktop/personalprograms/
